# Database Course Project (Spring 2020)

This repository contains the work completed for the **_Database systems_** course assignment, which was divided into two main parts: **Database Design** and **Implementation & Queries**. The project focuses on designing a relational database and executing various SQL queries in **MySQL**.

---

## First Part: Database Design

This phase involved the conceptualization and documentation of the database schema. The following steps were taken:

- **Choosing a Database Theme**: Selecting a theme with sufficient entities and relationships.
- **Conceptual Schema Design**: Documenting the schema based on chosen entities and their relationships.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**: Creating a reduced ER diagram using **Chen notation**, covering:
  - Entities
  - Relationships
  - Cardinalities of relationships
- **Accompanying Text**: Defining attributes for each entity or relationship, and specifying the primary key for each entity.
- **Relational Schema Conversion**: Converting the conceptual schema into a relational schema.
- **Normalization**: Applying normalization principles to ensure database integrity.

## Second Part: Implementation & Queries

This phase focused on the implementation of the designed database and performing SQL queries using **MySQL**. An internal application was used for accessing personal MySQL databases, providing the necessary permissions for creating and updating tables.

### Key Tasks:

- **Table Creation**: Designing and populating the tables with sufficient data rows.
- **Query Creation**: Developing four meaningful SQL queries that involve multiple tables. Some of the queries had to include **grouping** or be **nested**.
- **Query Documentation**: Detailed descriptions of each query, including:
  - **What the query returns**: Explanation of the result set (output table).
  - **How the query works**: Step-by-step description of the query's logic and execution process.

## Project Deliverables

For the second part of this assignment, only the **SQL queries** and their corresponding explanations are included in the repository. The commands for creating and populating the tables are not part of the deliverables.

The queries are stored in a _PDF_ file.
